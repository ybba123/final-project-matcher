# final-project-matcher

Some points we might cover:
- How to install required tools (you can link to tool pages for the main instructions).
- How to run your project.
- The general problem your project is tackling.

Also include:
- What tradeoffs did you make in choosing your representation? What else did you try that didnâ€™t work as well?
- What assumptions did you make about scope? What are the limits of your model?

Additional private components:                                 
Did your goals change at all from your proposal? Did you realize anything you planned was unrealistic, or that anything you thought was unrealistic was doable?
How should we understand an instance of your model, if applicable?
